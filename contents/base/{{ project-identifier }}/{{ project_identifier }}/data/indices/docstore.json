                    "parsed_text_markdown": "# Introduction\n\nThe presence of trace impurities in hydrogen gas can affect the performance and lifespan of fuel cell catalysts, making the analysis of trace impurities in hydrogen gas an important issue to be addressed in the development of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. Ammonia is a significant impurity in hydrogen gas, and the presence of trace amounts of ammonia can affect the performance of the battery, causing irreversible degradation.1\n\nTypically, the main methods for analyzing ammonia in hydrogen fuel are Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), ion chromatography (IC), ion-selective electrode method, and the GC/NCD method. The international standards ISO 14687-20192 and SAE J2719-20153 mention FTIR and IC for analysis, while GB/T 37244-20184 refers to the ion-selective electrode method for the determination of ammonia in hydrogen. Generally, the IC method and the ion-selective electrode method have higher sensitivity, but they require the use of additional solutions to absorb ammonia for analysis. This makes the sample preparation relatively complex. FTIR only requires filling the sample into the gas cell, which simplifies the sample preparation process, but its sensitivity is slightly inferior to the previous two methods.1 The GC/NCD method is highly selective and is not easily affected by other impurities in the hydrogen gas. It has high sensitivity and can fully meet the quality control requirements of 100 ppb mentioned in the ISO 14687-2019 and GB/T 37244-2018 methods. Moreover, the introduction of samples through the gas sampling valve eliminates the need for any additional pretreatment, simplifying the workflow.\n\nAgilent previously published an application note detailing the analysis of trace amounts of ammonia in ethylene using GC/NCD technology.5 Based on the hardware configuration of the previous note, this application note details an analysis method for trace amounts of ammonia in hydrogen for fuel cells. This GC/NCD method has high selectivity and sensitivity, and is able to meet the quality control requirements of trace ammonia analysis for the hydrogen fuel cell industry.\n\n# Experimental\n\nThis study is based on an 8890 GC, equipped with a six-port gas sampling valve and an NCD detector, which is used to complete the analysis of trace ammonia in hydrogen. In order to improve sensitivity, a 2 mL sample loop was installed, and the sample was directly injected into a dedicated ammonia column (Agilent J&W Select Low Ammonia column, part number CP8590) for analysis. The ammonia standard gas (9.9 \u03bcmol/mol) was purchased from Zhongce Standards Technology (Chengdu) Co., Ltd. The preparation of calibration standards to a parts-per-billion (ppb) level was carried out using a pneumatic control module (PCM) and a gas blending module (orderable for new instruments as SP-1 8890-0717). This module, which is also called a mini gas blender, operates by continuously merging a calibration gas with a matrix gas stream, thereby achieving the targeted concentration.\n\nFigure 1 illustrates the setup for sample dilution, introduction, and analysis. This study employed high-purity hydrogen (99.999% purity) as the dilution gas, and the dilution ratio is calculated based on the flow of the standard gas (F) and the flow of matrix (F).

                "text": "# Introduction\n\nThe presence of trace impurities in hydrogen gas can affect the performance and lifespan of fuel cell catalysts, making the analysis of trace impurities in hydrogen gas an important issue to be addressed in the development of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. Ammonia is a significant impurity in hydrogen gas, and the presence of trace amounts of ammonia can affect the performance of the battery, causing irreversible degradation.1\n\nTypically, the main methods for analyzing ammonia in hydrogen fuel are Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), ion chromatography (IC), ion-selective electrode method, and the GC/NCD method. The international standards ISO 14687-20192 and SAE J2719-20153 mention FTIR and IC for analysis, while GB/T 37244-20184 refers to the ion-selective electrode method for the determination of ammonia in hydrogen. Generally, the IC method and the ion-selective electrode method have higher sensitivity, but they require the use of additional solutions to absorb ammonia for analysis. This makes the sample preparation relatively complex. FTIR only requires filling the sample into the gas cell, which simplifies the sample preparation process, but its sensitivity is slightly inferior to the previous two methods.1 The GC/NCD method is highly selective and is not easily affected by other impurities in the hydrogen gas. It has high sensitivity and can fully meet the quality control requirements of 100 ppb mentioned in the ISO 14687-2019 and GB/T 37244-2018 methods. Moreover, the introduction of samples through the gas sampling valve eliminates the need for any additional pretreatment, simplifying the workflow.\n\nAgilent previously published an application note detailing the analysis of trace amounts of ammonia in ethylene using GC/NCD technology.5 Based on the hardware configuration of the previous note, this application note details an analysis method for trace amounts of ammonia in hydrogen for fuel cells. This GC/NCD method has high selectivity and sensitivity, and is able to meet the quality control requirements of trace ammonia analysis for the hydrogen fuel cell industry.\n\n# Experimental\n\nThis study is based on an 8890 GC, equipped with a six-port gas sampling valve and an NCD detector, which is used to complete the analysis of trace ammonia in hydrogen. In order to improve sensitivity, a 2 mL sample loop was installed, and the sample was directly injected into a dedicated ammonia column (Agilent J&W Select Low Ammonia column, part number CP8590) for analysis. The ammonia standard gas (9.9 \u03bcmol/mol) was purchased from Zhongce Standards Technology (Chengdu) Co., Ltd. The preparation of calibration standards to a parts-per-billion (ppb) level was carried out using a pneumatic control module (PCM) and a gas blending module (orderable for new instruments as SP-1 8890-0717). This module, which is also called a mini gas blender, operates by continuously merging a calibration gas with a matrix gas stream, thereby achieving the targeted concentration.\n\nFigure 1 illustrates the setup for sample dilution, introduction, and analysis. This study employed high-purity hydrogen (99.999% purity) as the dilution gas, and the dilution ratio is calculated based on the flow of the standard gas (F) and the flow of matrix (F). The dilution formula is as follows:2\n\nC2 = C1 \u00d7 (F1 / (F1 + F2))\n\nwhere C2 presents the concentration after dilution, C1 is the concentration of the original standard gas, F1 stands for the flow rate of the standard gas, and F2 indicates the flow rate of the diluent matrix gas.\n\n# Table 1: Instrument Conditions\n\n|Instrument|Condition|\n|---|---|\n|GC Model|8890|\n|Detector|NCD|\n|Sample Loop|2 mL|\n|Ammonia Column|Agilent J&W Select Low Ammonia|\n\n# Table 2: Ammonia Concentrations at Calibration Levels\n\n|Calibration Level|Concentration (ppb)|\n|---|---|\n|1|10|\n|2|20|\n|3|50|\n|4|100|\n|5|200|\n|6|500|\n\nFigure 1.

Although there is tailing of the peak shape, each run of the chromatogram overlaps very well. The excellent reproducibility of retention time and peak area indicates that this system is highly suitable for ammonia analysis, and it provides a good foundation for the accurate quantification of the real sample. Figure 5 lists the results of the %RSD of the peak area for eight runs at each concentration level.

This procedure was replicated at each calibration level. Figure 4 is an overlapped chromatogram of eight runs of ammonia with a concentration of 49.5 ppb. Although there is tailing of the peak shape, each run of the chromatogram overlaps very well. The excellent reproducibility of retention time and peak area indicates that this system is highly suitable for ammonia analysis, and it provides a good foundation for the accurate quantification of the real sample. Figure 5 lists the results of the %RSD of the peak area for eight runs at each concentration level. As the concentration decreases, the value of the %RSD correspondingly increases, which is consistent with our expectations. None of the results exceed 4.76%, which also indicates the excellent inertness and reliability of the system. In this study, the method detection limit (MDL) was evaluated by performing eight consecutive runs of standard gas at a concentration of 37.1 ppb. The concentration of ammonia was calculated using a linear equation, followed by the calculation of the standard deviation and multiplication by 3 to determine the MDL. The calculated MDL was 24.2 ppb.\n\n# Overlay of 49.5 ppb\n\nAmmonia\n\nFigure 4.

However, existing MS systems have issues with dechlorination of heavily chlorinated compounds. These issues would alter the mass spectra of a peak in the total ion chromatogram (TIC) and lead to potential misidentification of compounds. A newly designed extractor source called the Agilent HydroInert source for the Agilent 5977B Inert Plus GC/MSD addresses these hydrogen-related issues and helps improve performance with hydrogen carrier gas in GC/MS. The HydroInert source with hydrogen carrier gas retains mass spectral fidelity and allows users to continue using existing helium-based mass spectral libraries and quantitative methods.\n\n# Monitoring of chemicals in ambient air\n\nThis monitoring has driven the development of several national and international regulations, primarily in response to increased concern over potentially hazardous volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in ambient (primarily urban) air, industrial emissions, and landfill gas. Analysis of these VOCs is carried out in accordance with a few standard methods, which require the use of either sorbent tubes (pumped or passive), canisters, or online techniques. Each method has its own advantages and range of applicability, with canister sampling being most popular in the U.S. and China. To achieve the required detection limits using this approach, preconcentration is required to focus analytes and to selectively eliminate bulk constituents. This approach is mandated within the most popular standard method for canisters, U.S. EPA method TO-15.1\n\nDespite the popularity of canister sampling, traditional canister preconcentration technologies are challenged by the ever-greater range of analytes and concentrations of interest. The range of temperatures and humidities at sampling locations is also an issue. High levels of humidity are difficult because the ingress of water to the analytical instrument can negatively impact analyte response and repeatability, as well as reduce the lifetime of the column and detector.\n\n# Overview of U.S. EPA method TO-15\n\nThe key operations are summarized below.\n\n1. Sampling: After cleaning and evacuating the canister, it is brought to the sampling site. The canister valve is opened, and a flow controller draws air through a filter into the canister. After the sampling time corresponding to the set constant flow rate is reached, the canister valve is closed and sealed with caps.\n2. Storage: The sample is kept at ambient temperature and should be analyzed as soon as possible and no later than 20 days after sampling.\n3. Sample analysis: A known volume of sample is directed from the canister, which is connected to the canister autosampler through a water removal unit and into the multisorbent focusing trap within the concentrator system. The water removal unit will remove most of the water from the sample, and any water vapor remaining in the sample can further be reduced through purging the trap. After the concentration and drying steps are completed, the VOCs are thermally desorbed, entrained in a carrier gas stream, and transferred onto a GC column for separation.\n4. Compound identification and quantitation: Method TO-15 uses GC/MS for qualitative and quantitative analysis of samples. For linear quadrupole MS, monitoring of a wide m/z range (scan mode), or ion-selective scanning (SIM mode) patterns can be used to monitor the relevant target compounds. The mass spectra of the individual peaks in the TIC are examined, and VOCs are identified based on the intensities of quantifier and qualifier ions. The acquired mass spectra are then compared with library spectra (taken under similar conditions) to identify the compound. For any given compound, the abundance of the quantifier ion is compared to its abundance for the compound at known concentrations to determine the concentration of the compound in the sample.",

After the concentration and drying steps are completed, the VOCs are thermally desorbed, entrained in a carrier gas stream, and transferred onto a GC column for separation.\n4. Compound identification and quantitation: Method TO-15 uses GC/MS for qualitative and quantitative analysis of samples. For linear quadrupole MS, monitoring of a wide m/z range (scan mode), or ion-selective scanning (SIM mode) patterns can be used to monitor the relevant target compounds. The mass spectra of the individual peaks in the TIC are examined, and VOCs are identified based on the intensities of quantifier and qualifier ions. The acquired mass spectra are then compared with library spectra (taken under similar conditions) to identify the compound. For any given compound, the abundance of the quantifier ion is compared to its abundance for the compound at known concentrations to determine the concentration of the compound in the sample.",

Tables 1 and 2 display the canister, TD, GC, and MS parameters.\n\n# Standard preparation\n\nA 1 part per million (ppm) standard containing 65 \"air toxics\" compounds at 1 ppm was diluted in 6 L canisters with nitrogen balance gas to 10 parts per billion by volume (ppbv), unless otherwise stated. RH of 100% was achieved by injecting an appropriate volume of water into the canister.\n\n# Results and discussion\n\nA listing of results is provided in Table A1 (see Appendix).\n\n# Chromatography\n\nFigure 1 shows typical analyses of the 10 ppbv TO-15 standard at 100% RH, and Figure 2 shows extracted ion chromatograms (EICs) for 16 components spanning the volatility range. Note the excellent peak shape, especially for lighter VOCs, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the Kori-xr module at removing water before analyte trapping at 100% RH. Another noteworthy aspect is that hydrogen carrier gas decreases the GC cycle time by 40% (45 to 27 minutes), as indicated by the shift in naphthalene from 38 to 23 minutes, while maintaining retention time order for all compounds.

Key features of the results are the excellent chromatographic performance for the analysis of a 65-component TO-15 mix (from propene to naphthalene) at 100% relative humidity. Performance was well within the requirements of method TO-15, with method detection limits as low as 11 pptv.\n\nCrucially, this performance has been achieved for even the most volatile of components in the TO-15 mix, due to the efficient and selective removal of water from humid air streams without compromising the analysis of VOCs or polar species. In addition, the system uses electrical trap cooling, eliminating the cost and inconvenience associated with liquid cryogen. The Agilent HydroInert source with hydrogen carrier gas retained mass spectral fidelity, allowing users to continue the use of existing helium-based mass spectral libraries and quantitative methods.

                    "parsed_text_markdown": "# Introduction\n\nPetrochemicals are found in a vast range of modern everyday products, such as clothing, packaging, digital devices, detergents, tyres, medical equipment, and many more. Numerous modern energy systems are also reliant on petrochemicals, including solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, building insulation, and electric vehicles. Approximately 12% of global oil demand can be attributed to petrochemical feedstock, which is expected to increase given the rising demand for fertilisers, plastics, and other products1.\n\nBecause of their core role in the daily lives of people across the globe, petrochemicals significantly contribute to promoting the development of economies and improving standards of living.\n\nPetrochemical production focuses on maximizing ethylene and propylene yields, as well as by-product yields for other olefin and aromatic compounds. The testing and analysis of raw materials, intermediates, and finished products is essential to ensure that their quality meets recognised petrochemical standards.\n\nFurthermore, climate change concerns and the subsequent implementation of policies to achieve carbon peaking and neutrality goals are driving the energy sector to shift from fossil-fuel-based energy production to the use of alternative energy sources. Alternative energy includes renewables like biofuel and hydrogen, as well as energy storage devices such as lithium-ion batteries.

                "text": "# Introduction\n\nPetrochemicals are found in a vast range of modern everyday products, such as clothing, packaging, digital devices, detergents, tyres, medical equipment, and many more. Numerous modern energy systems are also reliant on petrochemicals, including solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, building insulation, and electric vehicles. Approximately 12% of global oil demand can be attributed to petrochemical feedstock, which is expected to increase given the rising demand for fertilisers, plastics, and other products1.\n\nBecause of their core role in the daily lives of people across the globe, petrochemicals significantly contribute to promoting the development of economies and improving standards of living.\n\nPetrochemical production focuses on maximizing ethylene and propylene yields, as well as by-product yields for other olefin and aromatic compounds. The testing and analysis of raw materials, intermediates, and finished products is essential to ensure that their quality meets recognised petrochemical standards.\n\nFurthermore, climate change concerns and the subsequent implementation of policies to achieve carbon peaking and neutrality goals are driving the energy sector to shift from fossil-fuel-based energy production to the use of alternative energy sources. Alternative energy includes renewables like biofuel and hydrogen, as well as energy storage devices such as lithium-ion batteries. Rigorous testing of alternative energy sources to ensure they are free of impurities is critical to ensure the safety of engines and production and manufacturing systems.\n\nIn response to the global demand for alternative energy sources, new downstream petrochemical processes, and accurate testing for petrochemical quality control, Agilent is pleased to announce a portfolio of advanced and intelligent gas chromatography (GC) analyzers. Our latest generation of GCs combine cutting-edge technology, leading intelligent features, and strong reliability to meet the needs of analytical testing and research laboratories across a broad range of applications in downstream petrochemical industries.

Like many foods, tea cultivation relies heavily on pesticide application to combat pests, leading to concerns over pesticide residues intensifying.1 Assessing pesticide levels in tea is essential for evaluating safety, and is required by many regulatory bodies, including the European Commission and the US Environmental Protection Agency.2,3 A complete workflow for pesticide testing in tea includes sample extraction via QuEChERS, followed by extract cleanup, and subsequent testing with liquid and gas chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC/TQ and GC/TQ).4 Workflow performance should enable sufficient method sensitivity, calibration range, pesticide recovery from the extraction, and precision. Sensitivity requirements are set based on the maximum residue levels (MRLs), which are the highest levels of pesticide residue that are legally allowed in or on food or feed when pesticides are applied correctly. The ability to calibrate over a wide dynamic range allows the varying MRLs for individual compounds monitored in the commodity, which can vary from 10 ppb to 100 ppm. When a specific pesticide lacks an established MRL, a default limit of 10 ppb is commonly applied. Efficiency of extraction and cleanup are characterized in terms of recovery of matrix spikes, and precision is expressed in terms of relative standard deviation (RSD) of repeat analyses.\n\nThis application note presents a complete GC/TQ workflow solution for the accurate and reliable analysis of 246 volatile and semivolatile pesticides in black tea. Excellent analytical performance of the workflow was achieved through a combination of cutting-edge technology and optimized methodology that included:\n\n- Sample preparation using QuEChERS extraction, followed by EMR mixed-mode pass-through cleanup using Agilent Captiva EMR\u2013GPD cartridges\n- Agilent 8890 GC hardware and GC supplies\n- Novel electron ionization (EI) source technology with HES 2.0\n- Built-in GC/TQ MS intelligence and new software functionality for method setup, maintenance, and system health evaluation\n\nThe presented workflow allowed for quantitating 246 pesticide residues in black tea with LOQs as low as 0.01 ppb for 34% of the targets, at or below 0.1 ppb for 74% of compounds, and below 2 ppb for 96%. Matrix-matched calibrations demonstrated excellent accuracy over a wide dynamic range, spanning up to five orders of magnitude over 0.01 to 1,000 ppb in the complex black tea extract. Method ruggedness was demonstrated through maintaining measurement accuracy with good precision (RSDs < 20% for 176 compounds) for black tea extract spiked at 2 ppb sequentially analyzed over 800 runs spanning 17 days of continuous analysis. The new HES 2.0 ion source is equipped with a novel dipolar radiofrequency (RF) lens that redirects the carrier gas ions and, as a result, enables improved system robustness and maximizes uptime while maintaining unparalleled analytical sensitivity.\n\n# Experimental\n\n# GC/TQ analysis\n\nThe 8890 GC and 7010D GC/TQ systems (Figure 1A) were used and configured to achieve the best sensitivity, maintain a wide calibration range, and provide the most rugged method performance. The GC was configured with the Agilent 7693A automatic liquid sampler (ALS) and 150-position tray. The system used a multimode inlet (MMI) operated in temperature-programmed splitless injection mode (also known as cold splitless). The injection parameters were optimized for maximizing sensitivity while limiting carryover. Midcolumn backflush capability was provided by the Agilent Purged Ultimate Union (PUU) installed between two identical 15 m columns, and the Agilent 8890 pneumatic switching device (PSD) module (Figure 1B). The instrument operating parameters are listed in Table 1.\n\nData were acquired in dynamic MRM (dMRM) mode, which provides the capability for large multi-analyte assays and the accurate quantitation of narrow peaks by an automatically determined most-efficient dwell time distribution. The dMRM capability enabled successful analysis for a large panel of 246 pesticides, with 749 total MRM transitions with up to 64 concurrent MRMs. Furthermore, dMRM allows the analyst to add and remove additional analytes with ease. The acquisition method was retention time locked to match the retention times in the Agilent MassHunter Pesticides and Environmental Pollutants MRM Database 4.0 (P&EP 4.0).",

The standard parathion-d10 (Agilent QuEChERS IS standard number 6, part number PPS-610-1) was used as the internal standard for quantitation of the target pesticides. It was added at 0.2 \u03bcL through reversed sandwich injection with the ALS to a final concentration of 10 ppb in the injected sample.\n\nAn appropriate calibration function, either linear or quadratic, guided by the lower value of the relative standard error (RSE) was used. A weighting factor of 1/x allowed for maintaining accuracy across the entire calibration range. The deviation of the back-calculated concentrations of the calibration standards from the true concentrations, using the calibration curve in the relevant region, did not exceed \u00b1 20%.\n\nThe concentrations expressed in ppb (w:v) correspond to the pesticide concentration in the injected sample. The QuEChERS sample preparation procedure described in the Sample preparation section resulted in a dilution factor of 5. Hence, the concentrations measured in the injected samples were five times lower than the corresponding concentration in the black tea sample, expressed in \u03bcg/kg.\n\nAnalyte protectants were not used in this work. The preliminary investigation showed that analyte protectants did not have a response enhancement effect on most of the compounds when analyzed in the rich and complex black tea matrix. It is of note that analyte protectants often significantly enhance target analyte response and stability as is described in-depth in the peer-reviewed literature.\n\n# Recovery evaluation\n\nSample preparation efficiency was evaluated by performing recovery studies. The surrogate black tea matrix was spiked at two different levels, 10 and 50 ppb, with six replicates at each level. The samples were extracted and cleaned up. Assuming 100% recovery, pesticide concentrations in the prespiked samples were expected to be 2 and 10 ppb due to a 5x dilution rate. A blank black tea extract was postspiked with the pesticide standard to achieve final concentrations of 2 and 10 ppb. The prespiked and postspiked samples were analyzed, and the response areas were compared. The recovery was measured as the ratio of the pesticide peak area in the prespiked sample to the area in the postspiked samples.\n\n# Results and discussion\n\nAs contemporary GC/MS technology continues to advance, so do the expectations for high sample throughput, intuitive user-friendly system setup and configuration, and streamlined maintenance. The demands for enhanced analytical performance are driven by the evolving regulations in pesticide residue analysis and food safety.\n\nSeveral best practices to achieve the best GC/TQ performance in pesticide residue analyses were described in Agilent application note 5994-4965EN. This work presents a complete workflow for analyzing 246 pesticides in black tea, while implementing the previously described best practices and offering further method and technology enhancements.\n\nThe innovative HES 2.0 yielded enhanced GC/TQ performance stability, as evidenced by precise results at the low concentration of 2 ppb over 800 consecutive injections of complex black tea extract.\n\nThe technology and method enhancements that enable unparalleled GC/TQ performance while ensuring stable and reliable results in a high-throughput setting are outlined in this application note and grouped into four categories: sample preparation, GC instrumentation and supplies, MS electron ionization technology advancements, and instrument intelligence and software functionality.\n\n# Effective matrix cleanup\n\nSample preparation is a key component of performing successful pesticide analysis. Performing analysis of samples prepared by QuEChERS extraction, particularly when analyzing complex pigmented samples such as black tea without adequate cleanup, can lead to increased system maintenance. The parts of the system that are affected without adequate sample cleanup include liner replacement, GC column trimming, and inlet and MS source cleaning. As a result, throughput is decreased. Further, the presence of large amounts of matrix can affect the accuracy of results, often most pronounced with difficult to analyze pesticides.\n\nThe EMR mixed-mode pass-through cleanup using Captiva EMR with Carbon S cartridges is a simplified procedure that demonstrates an improvement on both sample matrix removal, and overall recovery and reproducibility of targets. As shown in Figure 5, the abundance of the TIC signal in full scan data acquisition mode was noticeably reduced for black tea extract after cleanup when comparing the crude extracts before cleanup.",

                    "parsed_text_markdown": "The graph shows that analyte responses were stable and within 80 to 120% throughout the entire study that lasted over 17 days of continuous analysis. The RSDs for each of the target responses are shown in the legend in Figure 14, with most of them below 12%. The absolute responses in terms of peak areas also remained consistent throughout the longevity study. For example, the RSDs on the peak areas over 800 injections for early-eluting BHC-beta, mid-range eluting fenson, and late-eluting coumaphos were 9%, 10%, and 16%, respectively.\n\nThe maintenance performed during the robustness testing involved septum and liner replacement every 100 injections. With the midcolumn backflush configuration and the use of the temperature-programmed MMI inlet, inlet liner and septum replacement could be performed in under four minutes, providing a productivity boost to the workflow.\n\nTwo inches of the GC column head were trimmed after 500 injections. The use of the backflushing allowed for a substantial increase in the number of injections before column head maintenance was needed when analyzing a complex black tea extract. Similar to GC inlet maintenance, column trimming could be performed efficiently in a short amount of time (5 to 10 minutes) and did not require MS cool-down and venting due to the midcolumn configuration coupled with the temperature-programmed MMI.\n\nThe autoinjector syringe was replaced after 600 injections in the longevity study, as noted in Figure 14, with a total of 1,000 injections made with the syringe. The decision to replace the syringe was driven by the decreased measurement precision resulting from a higher variability in the target and ISTD responses. The replacement procedure was performed as guided by the user manual for the 7693A ALS. The precision of measurements was restored after the syringe replacement. As a result, the graph in Figure 14 shows an increased response variability between 500 and 600 injections. This effect was particularly pronounced for deltamethrin, which can present a challenge for achieving good precision at low concentrations. Washing the syringe needle support foot is an additional autoinjector maintenance procedure to consider when analyzing challenging samples to minimize carryover and ensure precision.\n\nIt is of note that there was no need to perform GC inlet or MS source cleaning during the entire study, which spanned over 1,000 injections, including the calibration assessment and precision and recovery studies.\n\nThe exceptional method ruggedness shown in this work was achieved by:\n\n- Following the key practices to successful pesticide analysis outlined in this application note and in another application note\n- Performing effective sample preparation and cleanup\n- Using the state-of-the art GC and MS technology in the 8890 and 7010D GC/TQ systems\n\n# GC/TQ intelligence and new software functionality\n\nThe health and status of the GC/TQ system was continuously monitored though the longevity study by using the Early Maintenance Feedback functionality in MassHunter Acquisition 13.0 for GC/MS. Figure 15A shows a screenshot of the MS health status, featuring the electron multiplier (EM) voltage at last tune, filament age, pump maintenance schedule, and time since the source was cleaned. The dashboard allows for daily tracking for essential maintenance procedures and reminds the user to perform maintenance on time. In addition to the dashboard view, the built-in intelligent functionality in the 7010D GC/TQ system allows for plotting tune-related parameters over time to track the EI source health and performance. The plot for the EM voltage is shown in Figure 15B. The routine tune check procedures, which could be built into the sequence table via keywords, are helpful in guiding when the EM gain curve needs to be updated. This procedure allows for adjusting the EM voltage to maintain a stable response while not altering tune parameters and ion ratio, maintaining MS tune and method calibration validity.",

The absolute responses in terms of peak areas also remained consistent throughout the longevity study. For example, the RSDs on the peak areas over 800 injections for early-eluting BHC-beta, mid-range eluting fenson, and late-eluting coumaphos were 9%, 10%, and 16%, respectively.\n\nThe maintenance performed during the robustness testing involved septum and liner replacement every 100 injections. With the midcolumn backflush configuration and the use of the temperature-programmed MMI inlet, inlet liner and septum replacement could be performed in under four minutes, providing a productivity boost to the workflow.\n\nTwo inches of the GC column head were trimmed after 500 injections. The use of the backflushing allowed for a substantial increase in the number of injections before column head maintenance was needed when analyzing a complex black tea extract. Similar to GC inlet maintenance, column trimming could be performed efficiently in a short amount of time (5 to 10 minutes) and did not require MS cool-down and venting due to the midcolumn configuration coupled with the temperature-programmed MMI.\n\nThe autoinjector syringe was replaced after 600 injections in the longevity study, as noted in Figure 14, with a total of 1,000 injections made with the syringe. The decision to replace the syringe was driven by the decreased measurement precision resulting from a higher variability in the target and ISTD responses. The replacement procedure was performed as guided by the user manual for the 7693A ALS. The precision of measurements was restored after the syringe replacement. As a result, the graph in Figure 14 shows an increased response variability between 500 and 600 injections. This effect was particularly pronounced for deltamethrin, which can present a challenge for achieving good precision at low concentrations. Washing the syringe needle support foot is an additional autoinjector maintenance procedure to consider when analyzing challenging samples to minimize carryover and ensure precision.\n\nIt is of note that there was no need to perform GC inlet or MS source cleaning during the entire study, which spanned over 1,000 injections, including the calibration assessment and precision and recovery studies.\n\nThe exceptional method ruggedness shown in this work was achieved by:\n\n- Following the key practices to successful pesticide analysis outlined in this application note and in another application note\n- Performing effective sample preparation and cleanup\n- Using the state-of-the art GC and MS technology in the 8890 and 7010D GC/TQ systems\n\n# GC/TQ intelligence and new software functionality\n\nThe health and status of the GC/TQ system was continuously monitored though the longevity study by using the Early Maintenance Feedback functionality in MassHunter Acquisition 13.0 for GC/MS. Figure 15A shows a screenshot of the MS health status, featuring the electron multiplier (EM) voltage at last tune, filament age, pump maintenance schedule, and time since the source was cleaned. The dashboard allows for daily tracking for essential maintenance procedures and reminds the user to perform maintenance on time. In addition to the dashboard view, the built-in intelligent functionality in the 7010D GC/TQ system allows for plotting tune-related parameters over time to track the EI source health and performance. The plot for the EM voltage is shown in Figure 15B. The routine tune check procedures, which could be built into the sequence table via keywords, are helpful in guiding when the EM gain curve needs to be updated. This procedure allows for adjusting the EM voltage to maintain a stable response while not altering tune parameters and ion ratio, maintaining MS tune and method calibration validity.",

Usually, the detection methods such as triple quadrupole GC/MS and triple quadrupole LC/MS are aimed at a specific list of targets that are commonly found in food samples. These methods can be effective but may overlook any residues that are not specifically targeted. The approach to overcome this challenge is to perform untargeted screening of the sample intending to find as many compounds of concern as possible and allowing for retrospective analysis. Untargeted screening can be accomplished by analyzing the sample in full scan data acquisition mode. However, targeted triple quadrupole GC/MS (GC/TQ) analysis has an advantage of higher sensitivity and selectivity for the target analytes when compared to full scan analysis.\n\nThe novel simultaneous dynamic MRM and scan (dMRM/scan) allows for acquiring both targeted dMRM GC/TQ data for target quantitation as well as full scan data for unknowns screening. Also, the simultaneous dynamic MRM and scan (dMRM/scan) deliver confident identification based on spectral library matching. In this work, three challenging matrices, including a high-chlorophyll fresh spinach matrix, an oily dry walnut matrix, and a complex dry cayenne pepper matrix were used. The matrix blank extracts were post spiked with over 200 GC-amenable pesticides. The samples at various concentration levels were analyzed in dMRM/scan data acquisition mode enabling target quantitation with dMRM data and unknown identification with the simultaneously acquired full scan data.\n\nThe performance of the targeted GC/TQ method component was evaluated based on the method sensitivity and the calibration performance over a dynamic range.

This calibration range encompassed the varying maximum residue limits (MRLs) for pesticides regulated in the analyzed commodities. The GC was configured with the Agilent 7693A automatic liquid sampler (ALS) and 150-position tray. The system used a multimode inlet (MMI) operated in temperature-programmed splitless injection mode.

The application note 5994-4965EN4 describes the importance of analyzing matrix in full scan mode. This analysis allows users to evaluate the absolute abundance of the total ion chromatogram (TIC), which is recommended not to exceed 7 \u00d7 107 counts for GC/TQ. Evaluation of the TIC in full scan mode can signal that the EI source might be overloaded with matrix at any retention time. Source overloading could lead to compromised sensitivity and quantitation accuracy of coeluting analytes.\n\n# Sample extraction\n\n|10 g of spinach or 5 g of walnut powder or 2 g of cayenne pepper powder|\u2013 10 mL of water to dry matrices; vortex for 10 minutes|\u2013 10 mL of ACN with 1% AA|\n|---|---|---|\n|Centrifuge|Centrifuge|Centrifuge|\n|Take 3 mL supernatant directly or mix with 10 to 20% water|Agilent QuEChERS EN extraction kit|Agilent QuEChERS EN extraction kit|\n\n# Sample cleanup\n\n|Spinach on Agilent Captiva EMR\u2013HCF|Walnut on Agilent Captiva EMR\u2013LPD|Cayenne pepper on Agilent Captiva EMR\u2013GPD|\n|---|---|---|\n|Sample eluent drying|Sample analysis on GC/TQ|Sample analysis on GC/TQ|\n\nFigure 3.

The graph shows the number of compounds and their calibration ranges.\n\nAs expected, considering the recommended loading for the high efficiency source (HES) not to exceed 1 ng per analyte, the upper calibration limit for the 7010C was lower when compared to the 7000E (1,000 ppb versus 5,000 ppb). However, the calibration range achieved with the 7010C was up to four orders of magnitude with a linear fit for most of the analyzed compounds. The 7010C GC/TQ equipped with the HES enables superior sensitivity yielding high signal-to-noise (S/N) at low concentrations and allows for accurate quantitation at concentrations below 0.1 ppb. However, this sensitivity was not required in this work as the MRLs for pesticides regulated in the commodities of interest did not require sub 0.1 ppb quantitation. Alternatively, samples with the MRLs above 1,000 ppb can be further diluted before the analysis with the 7010C GC/TQ. The HES enables maintaining high sensitivity at the LOQ level even in the diluted samples.",

The graph shows the number of compounds and their calibration ranges.\n\nAs expected, considering the recommended loading for the high efficiency source (HES) not to exceed 1 ng per analyte, the upper calibration limit for the 7010C was lower when compared to the 7000E (1,000 ppb versus 5,000 ppb). However, the calibration range achieved with the 7010C was up to four orders of magnitude with a linear fit for most of the analyzed compounds. The 7010C GC/TQ equipped with the HES enables superior sensitivity yielding high signal-to-noise (S/N) at low concentrations and allows for accurate quantitation at concentrations below 0.1 ppb. However, this sensitivity was not required in this work as the MRLs for pesticides regulated in the commodities of interest did not require sub 0.1 ppb quantitation. Alternatively, samples with the MRLs above 1,000 ppb can be further diluted before the analysis with the 7010C GC/TQ. The HES enables maintaining high sensitivity at the LOQ level even in the diluted samples.",

                    "parsed_text_markdown": "# Introduction\n\nOne of the common ways for humans to encounter PAH exposure is through food consumption. Several countries have drafted legislation to establish tolerable limits for PAHs in foods, food products, and beverages, as well as to enforce monitoring strategies for the most relevant compounds. Furthermore, regulatory agencies such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Commission (EC) have launched regulations to decrease the concentration of PAHs in food, especially through strategies to control the processes that induce their formation. There is particular concern about the levels of PAHs in infant formula. The EC defines infants as \"children under the age of 12 months,\" and infant formula as \"food used by infants during the first months of life and satisfying by themselves the nutritional requirements of such infants until the introduction of appropriate complementary feeding.\"\n\n# The Captiva EMR\u2013Lipid pass-through cleanup has gained considerable attention since its introduction.\n\nThe EMR\u2013Lipid sorbent selectively interacts with the unbranched hydrocarbon chains of lipids, leaving \"bulky\" target analytes in solution for subsequent analysis. This selective interaction mechanism makes it ideal for multiclass, multiresidue analysis in fatty-food matrices. With the increased global helium (He) crisis in the market, laboratories are looking for a more sustainable alternative to helium and exploring the option of H2 carrier gas. The economic benefits of H2 carrier gas for GC are widely known but resulting hydrogenation and dichlorination reactions in the MS source may occur, and thus make the application of H2 for GC/MS and GC/MS/MS challenging. The Agilent HydroInert source is a newly designed extractor source for GC/MSD that addresses these issues and improves performance with H2 carrier gas in GC/MS.\n\n# Sample preparation\n\nThe sample preparation method development followed the previously published PAH method used in beef and salmon. Prior to a solvent extraction, infant formula powder first needs to be dissolved in water. The crude extract can then further be cleaned using Captiva EMR\u2013Lipid 3 mL cartridges. For the analysis of PAHs on the GC/MS, the cleaned extract was back-extracted with isooctane\u2014a more GC-amenable solvent. An outline of the sample preparation procedure is shown in Figure 1. The entire sample preparation procedure introduced a 5\u00d7 dilution of the infant formula powder sample.\n\n# Instrumental analysis\n\nRegarding quantification, PAHs can be quantified using GC/MS. GC/MS allows accurate identification of the target analytes and their respective internal standards with high selectivity, thereby reducing analytical errors. The PAH extraction from infant formula was performed using H2 and the HydroInert source on the 8890 GC coupled with a 5977C GC/MSD.\n\n# Current European legislation\n\nThis study investigates the analysis of PAHs in infant formula using Captiva EMR\u2013Lipid pass-through cleanup for sample preparation, followed by GC/MS using the HydroInert source and H2 carrier gas. According to Commission Regulation (EU) number 835/2011, the content of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and PAH4 (the sum of BaP, benz[a]anthracene (BaA), benzo[b]fluoranthene (BbF), and chrysene (Chr)) in processed cereal-based food and baby food for infants and young children should not exceed 1 \u03bcg/kg.",

The Agilent HydroInert source is a newly designed extractor source for GC/MSD that addresses these issues and improves performance with H2 carrier gas in GC/MS.\n\n# Sample preparation\n\nThe sample preparation method development followed the previously published PAH method used in beef and salmon. Prior to a solvent extraction, infant formula powder first needs to be dissolved in water. The crude extract can then further be cleaned using Captiva EMR\u2013Lipid 3 mL cartridges. For the analysis of PAHs on the GC/MS, the cleaned extract was back-extracted with isooctane\u2014a more GC-amenable solvent. An outline of the sample preparation procedure is shown in Figure 1. The entire sample preparation procedure introduced a 5\u00d7 dilution of the infant formula powder sample.\n\n# Instrumental analysis\n\nRegarding quantification, PAHs can be quantified using GC/MS. GC/MS allows accurate identification of the target analytes and their respective internal standards with high selectivity, thereby reducing analytical errors. The PAH extraction from infant formula was performed using H2 and the HydroInert source on the 8890 GC coupled with a 5977C GC/MSD.\n\n# Current European legislation\n\nThis study investigates the analysis of PAHs in infant formula using Captiva EMR\u2013Lipid pass-through cleanup for sample preparation, followed by GC/MS using the HydroInert source and H2 carrier gas. According to Commission Regulation (EU) number 835/2011, the content of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and PAH4 (the sum of BaP, benz[a]anthracene (BaA), benzo[b]fluoranthene (BbF), and chrysene (Chr)) in processed cereal-based food and baby food for infants and young children should not exceed 1 \u03bcg/kg.",

PAHs are highly hydrophobic compounds, especially heavy PAHs with three or four rings, which typically bear high log P values above 5.

Despite necessary compromises, H2, O/N, CO, CO2, and C2 to C8 alkanes can be analyzed simultaneously with only two channels, with excellent repeatability and a short analysis time (&lt; 5 minutes). The repeatability of gross heating value is below 0.025%, which is a good benchmark in the current market.",

Natural gas is mainly used as a high-quality fuel, and is priced based on its calorific value in mainstream markets, which requires an accurate analysis of its composition. Usually, natural gas is composed of methane (&gt; 80%), ethane, a small amount of propane, nitrogen, CO, butane, pentane, and trace C6 to C8 alkanes. Components of C9 and above have little effect on its calorific value due to their extremely low content. Recently, there is a new trend to add hydrogen into natural gas to reduce carbon emissions during combustion. Therefore, hydrogen analysis should also be taken into consideration.\n\nThe Agilent 990 Micro GC can provide fast and accurate gas analysis with low power and carrier gas consumption, making it an ideal tool for the online analysis of natural gas. In this application, two analytical channels of the 990 Micro GC were used, namely 1 m COX BF and 8 m 5CB. The application of the COX channel enables the simultaneous analysis of H, O2/N2, CH4, CO, and CO2, with excellent stability for moisture-containing samples. It takes only five minutes to analyze natural gas (H, O2/N2, CO, C1 to C8 alkanes) in one injection, with excellent repeatability for multiple analyses.\n\n# Experimental\n\nThe 990 Micro GC system is equipped with a 1 m COX backflush channel, and an 8 m 5CB straight channel.
